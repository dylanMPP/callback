# **Divide and Conquer**

### Dylan Bermudez Cardona - Luis Charria Meneses - Luis Pinillos Sanchez

This is a project that consists of three problems that are essentially solved using the 'Divide and Conquer' strategy. In addition, recursion (tail and pure) and sorting methods such as MergeSort and QuickSort are used. In turn, unit tests are implemented to verify the proper functioning of the functions.
